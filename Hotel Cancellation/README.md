# About this repository:

This repository contains a Machine Learning project to help the hotel property about customer who cancel the booking order using the [Hotel Booking](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barathsrinath/hotel-booking) dataset.<br>

Here the summary of the results of this project:

## **Business Problem Understanding**
