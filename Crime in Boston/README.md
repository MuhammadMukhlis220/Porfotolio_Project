# About this repository:

This repository contains a Data Analysis project to analyzed crime behavior on Boston using the [Crime in Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston) dataset.<br> <br>
Warning: **Some plot results not showing on github because using plotly express, you can see the plot by downloading the file first then opening it in jupyter or your vs code** <br> <br>
Here the summary of the results of this project:

## **Business Problem Understanding**

**Context**
**Background**

According to Cornell Law School, "Crime is behavior, either by act or omission, defined by statutory or common law as deserving of punishment or penalty" ([par 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/crime#:~:text=A%20crime%20is%20behavior%20that,common%20law%20still%20carries%20force.)). This means any action, whether intentional or not, that is defined by law as an act worthy of punishment or sanction. Although generally, this law violation requires the intention of the perpetrator, there are minor legal violations that occur without the intention of the person doing it, such as parking violations. Violating the law is categorized as a major violation of public order (crime/felony) or a lesser offense (misdemeanor) and will be prosecuted according to the applicable procedure.

<br>
In America, calling the police 911 (contact center) is very common. In addition to following up on complaints, police in America usually have a patrol schedule to anticipate violations of the law. Generally, eyewitnesses will call 911. 911 or dispatcher will record the report on the form on the computer at the same time while the reporter is still connected to him. If it is felt that there is an "emergency" that needs to be handled quickly and immediately (for example, as someone who is about to do something that endangers himself and/or other people around him or reports about a robbery that is happening) usually the dispatcher will immediately send information to the police and paramedics (if there is an emergency) right away to visit the crime scene. This information is usually about what happened and where it happened. The police and paramedics immediately received the report and followed up on report right away. After completing the case, the police are required to report all matters related to the incident.

<br>
With the police and the rapid reporting and action described above, it does not mean that there is no lawlessness in America. A person breaking the law is not always because of revenge or because there are things to be fulfilled (economic pressure or other needs), but it can also be due to negligence, depending on the background of the perpetrator. So we can be concluded that law violations cannot be eliminated, but can be prevented by preventive actions from law enforcement.

**Problem Formulation**

Taken from the [City of Boston](https://www.boston.gov/departments/police)"s website, "The Boston Police Department is dedicated to working in partnership with the community to fight crime. We work to improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods". Boston PD works with the community to help each other to create a better quality of life. **The Boston Police are committed to reducing crime rates** in their area.

"The executive head of the department" of Boston PD, in this case, the police commissioner, together with high-ranking officials of Boston PD want to evaluate the incidence of major and minor violations of the law that occurred in the Boston area, Massachusetts, USA, from June 2015 to September 2018 to get "insight", so that the services provided to the people of Boston can be improved and the commitment to creating a better quality of life in Boston can be realized. As a "criminology consultant", I will answer the question **whether the lawlessness in Boston has been successfully suppressed** with the following formulation of the problem.

**What is the trend of law violations in Boston?**

Later, we will discuss the types of law violations that occur the most, the times when violations of the law generally occur, and the locations with the highest level of violations. Has the presence of Boston PD helped reduce lawlessness? What recommendations can be given so  Boston PD can provide a greater sense of security to the people of Boston?
