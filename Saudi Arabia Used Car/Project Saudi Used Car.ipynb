    "\n",
    "Transportation is a vital tool in supporting human life. One of the most popular types of transportation in Saudi Arabia is the car. Cars are a primary level of transportation need compared to motorbikes in Saudi Arabia. The high temperatures in Arabia, make motorcycles very unattractive and make automobiles more sought after. In addition to this, with the elimination of the rules for women who are prohibited from working and driving in 2019, cars are increasingly in demand. The article which covers the Market Opportunity of used cars in Saudi Arabia said that the ratio of buying a used car to a new car is 2: 1. This can still increase over time due to the good economic growth in Saudi Arabia.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Due to a large number of used cars in demand, there are a number of platforms on websites like syarah.com that are interested in being a medium for buying and selling used cars. syarah.com, which was founded in 2015, is one of the largest used car buying and selling platforms in Saudi Arabia. At syarah.com, customers can choose the car according to their wishes by matching the desired specifications and prices. On the web, there are also many features that are shown so that the specifications of the car are more complete. The higher the specifications of the car owned, the higher the price of the car installed. If we talk in more detail about the price, determining the price of a used car will be more complicated considering the difficulty of determining the market price by looking at so many specifications. Not to mention the emergence of new features on the latest cars that make used car prices go down. Determining the price of a used car is not necessarily easy to calculate. Therefore, we need a tool called machine learning to make used car prices more accurate.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Machine learning can study various previous transaction data and will produce a model that can be used by companies such as syarah.com. With machine learning, it is hoped that prices will be more competitive in the market for buying and selling used cars. Another reason why these tools are needed is that not all potential sellers understand the specifications of their cars. If they (the seller) sell at a high price, then the car will be difficult to sell. And vice versa if the selling price is too low, the profits will be smaller. Not to mention that syarah.com also took part in the proceeds of the car sales transactions that occurred. In the end, machine learning is expected to make all elements in the world of buying and selling used cars, be it companies (syarah.com), prospective buyers, and potential sellers, will both benefit from providing accurate and competitive used car prices.\n",

    "\n",
    "The problem will have a direct impact on the company and potential sellers because, for potential buyers, low prices below market standards will be in great demand. For companies, solving problems to get a good business model will have a positive impact by making the financial and user experience of prospective sellers and buyers better so that they are more in demand.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As for potential sellers, the business model generated by the company will reduce the time spent researching used car prices. Don't forget that the selling price will be sold competitively so that the profit taken is maximized.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For potential buyers, the time they spend comparing prices will also be reduced. This is because if the company's business model can be generated, then all prices on the platform are competitive prices so they don't have to worry about the prices they see being too expensive or too cheap.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "With so many specifications and conditions on used cars, **the company is expected to be able to provide a good business model in determining accurate prices** so that many potential buyers or customers are increasingly interested in this company. Prospective buyers will also be given the convenience of determining the desired specifications and prices without worrying about whether the choice is wrong or the right one. This accurate price and convenience can attract many customers to shop at this company and of course will increase the company's financial income."

    "Based on these problems, the syarah.com company needs to have the tools so that prospective buyers can determine their dream car by looking at various specifications and accurate prices according to their wishes and needs. Car specification variables such as car brand, year of car, mileage, and others are expected to increase good accuracy in determining car prices. This is what makes the price of the car able to compete in the market so that the company can take as much profit as possible."

The next step will be to create a regression model that will help the company to be able to provide a used car price prediction tool. Determination of the regression model will be determined by looking at the best evaluation matrix so that the final model of machine learning can be determined."

In analyzing the data, of course, we will think that the data outlier is very disturbing. However, not all data outliers must be deleted because the placement of the data is correct as it is based on accepted facts and reality. In data science, we often make assumptions about a particular population. However, the existence of an extreme outlier value can have a significant impact on the interpretation results that we observe from machine learning data or models. With proper handling, we can consider extreme outlier data as distinct populations."

    "From the plot and table above, this model is only able to predict the price of a used car starting from 20 thousand SAR to 350 thousand SAR. This predictive ability is seen from the MAPE metric evaluation values ​​for each range compared to the MAPE metric evaluation values ​​of all test data. This matrix was chosen because MAPE is a predictive scoring matrix whose final difference will be a percentage. It can be seen that the worst prediction range is below 10 thousand SAR because the MAPE value reaches 265%. Followed by a range of 10k - 20k SAR with 45% MAPE. After that range, the model is considered good because it is able to predict with its MAPE value close to the MAPE value of the test data. The final limit of this model is at a maximum value of 350 thousand SAR if it is based on the MAPE value of the test data. If we look at the highest price, which is 620 thousand SAR, the price is very far from predictions. This is because the higher the price of the car, the better the quality of the brand name and the smaller the number. Natural law applies to car ownership that the higher the price of the goods owned, the fewer people who have these expensive goods. The fewer types of car brands that are sold, the model becomes **lack of data** for the small number of brands. This is what makes the high car price predictions can be wrong."

    "    - learning_rate : 0.05\n",
    "    - max_depth : 9\n",
    "    - n_estimators : 250<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. From the modeling done, the \"Year\" feature greatly affects the price of a used car.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From removing extreme outliers from 2 columns, the limitations are obtained as follows:\n",
    "    - The maximum price is 620000 SAR.\n",
    "    - The oldest used car year is 1978.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. The target variable \"Price\" which has a value of 0 is not used in the modeling because it is negotiating. While in *Machine Learning* we need exact numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Based on the Matrix Evaluation, this model has an error of around 14329 SAR (from MAE) or 23% (from MAPE) the prediction will deviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. From the results of the plot and price range table, we know a number of additional model limitations, namely:\n",
    "    - The fewer the number of car brands being sold, the more difficult the model will be to predict the price.\n",
    "    - For a car that if you want to sell under 10k SAR, this model is not suitable for use.\n",
    "    - At least it takes a number of the same car brand so that the price prediction can be accurate, especially for high prices. For example, we take the Ghost brand (the only 1 in this dataset) from Rolls-Royce. If the same brand enters, the price will be predicted to deviate considerably due to the lack of data for the Ghost car brand from Rolls-Royce."
