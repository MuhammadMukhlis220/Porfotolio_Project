## **Business Problem Understanding**

**Context**
**Background**

Transportation is a vital tool in supporting human life. One of the most popular types of transportation in Saudi Arabia is the car. Cars are a primary level of transportation need compared to motorbikes in Saudi Arabia. The high temperatures in Arabia, make motorcycles very unattractive and make automobiles more sought after. In addition to this, with the elimination of the rules for women who are prohibited from working and driving in 2019, cars are increasingly in demand. The article which covers the Market Opportunity of used cars in Saudi Arabia said "the ratio of buying a used car to a new car is 2: 1". This can still increase over time due to the good economic growth in Saudi Arabia.

Due to a large number of used cars in demand, there are a number of platforms on websites like syarah.com that are interested in being a medium for buying and selling used cars. syarah.com, which was founded in 2015, is one of the largest used car buying and selling platforms in Saudi Arabia. At syarah.com, customers can choose the car according to their wishes by matching the desired specifications and prices. On the web, there are also many features are shown so the specifications of the car are more complete. The higher the specifications of the car owned, the higher the price of the car installed. If we talk in more detail about the price, determining the price of a used car will be more complicated considering the difficulty of determining the market price by looking at so many specifications. Not to mention the emergence of new features on the latest cars that make used car prices go down. Determining the price of a used car is not necessarily easy to calculate. Therefore, we need a tool called machine learning to make used car prices more accurate.

Machine learning can learn various previous transaction data and will produce a model can be used by companies such as syarah.com. With machine learning, it is hoped that prices will be more competitive in the market for buying and selling used cars. Another reason why these tools are needed is not all potential sellers understand the specifications of their cars. If they (the seller) sell at a high price, then the car will be difficult to sell. And vice versa if the selling price is too low, the profits will be smaller. Not to mention syarah.com also took part in the proceeds of the car sales transactions that occurred. In the end, machine learning is expected to make all elements in the world of buying and selling used cars, be it companies (syarah.com), prospective buyers, and potential sellers, will both benefit from providing accurate and competitive used car prices.

**Problem Statement**

The problem will have a direct impact on the company and potential sellers because, for potential buyers, low prices below market standards will be in great demand. For companies, solving problems to get a good business model will have a positive impact by making the financial and user experience of prospective sellers and buyers better so they are more in demand.

As for potential sellers, the business model generated by the company will reduce the time spent researching used car prices. Don't forget the selling price will be sold competitively so the profit taken is maximized.

For potential buyers, the time they spend comparing prices will also be reduced. This is because if the company's business model can be generated, then all prices on the platform are competitive prices so they don't have to worry about the prices they see being too expensive or too cheap.

With so many specifications and conditions on used cars, the company is expected to be able to provide a good business model in determining accurate prices so many potential buyers or customers are increasingly interested in this company. Prospective buyers will also be given the convenience of determining the desired specifications and prices without worrying about whether the choice is wrong or the right one. This accurate price and convenience can attract many customers to shop at this company and of course will increase the company's financial income.
