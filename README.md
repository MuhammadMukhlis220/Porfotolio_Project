Hi, I'am Mukhlis~

I'm a passionate Data enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and over 2 years of professional experience in the data field.

I specialize in processing large-scale datasets, building robust data pipelines, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I began my career as a Data Analyst at PT Telekomunikasi Selular Indonesia, where I supported strategic decision-making through data-driven analysis. Currently, I'm working as a Data Engineer at PT Optimasi Data Indonesia, focusing on data infrastructure, pipeline optimization, and scalable data solutions.

With a strong technical foundation and business-oriented mindset, I aim to build impactful solutions through data.

**My expertise across the data lifecycle:**

## 1. Optimasi Data Indonesia - Data Engineer
### March 2024 - Present
**1. Football Player Statistic**
   
<p align="justify">
In this project, I am responsible for preparing a use case related to football player statistics for potential clients from one of the largest football clubs in Indonesia. Data is taken from the website <a href="https://www.sofascore.com">Sofascore</a> using the available API. I tried to find freely available APIs besides Sofascore, but it is quite difficult because most API service providers for football player statistics are subscription-based. Unfortunately, Sofascore only provides player statistics based on their overall performance, making it challenging to determine the development of players from each match played. The player data collected includes players from the top 5 European leagues (English Premier League, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany) and BRI Liga 1 Indonesia.

<p align="justify"> The data extraction process from the web is executed using <strong>Apache Airflow</strong> as a data orchestration tool scheduled to pull data weekly through the API while considering the match schedules between countries from FIFA. The data collected is inserted into <strong>OpenSearch</strong> for visualization. </p>

Here is the Sofascore data retrieved via the available API:

<p align="justify">
From the website's page, we can use the "inspect" feature. "Inspect" allows us to view and modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used to build the webpage directly. This is very useful for web developers, users, and data analysts who want to understand the structure or inspect certain elements on the page. </p>

From the image above, Sofascore does not only provide a single API for one player. Here is one of the API contents provided by Sofascore related to player statistics.

<p align="justify">
Once the API is identified, I used Python programming on Apache Airflow to fetch the data through web scraping with a weekly interval. The number of tasks is determined by the number of selected leagues (6 leagues), and all APIs are fetched simultaneously to optimize time. </p>

Once the data is ingested into OpenSearch, I created a visualization dashboard to monitor player performance statistics. The visualization can be adjusted using a timestamp set to one week ago, ensuring that older data will not be visualized. Here is the dashboard created:

The three dashboard images above are interactive, allowing for filtering by club name or player name.

**2. Ministry Application**

<p align="justify">
In this project, I had the opportunity to be the PIC for transferring data from a ministry's database (PostgreSQL) into a dedicated application. This data contains regional budgets that internally need to be disseminated to local governments using the application to be developed. My company was chosen to take responsibility for the application's database with our product, the <a href="https://onyx.id/">Onyx Big Data Platform</a>. Onyx leverages many open-source applications; in this project, the applications used are <strong>Apache Hadoop</strong>, <strong>Apache Airflow</strong>, <strong>Apache Hive</strong>, <strong>Apache Zeppelin</strong>, <strong>Apache Spark</strong>, and <strong>OpenSearch</strong>.
</p>

![Alt Text](/pic/application_flow.jpg)

Figure 2.1

<p align="justify">
Apache Airflow serves as the orchestration tool to schedule the data flow from the ministry's database to <strong>Apache Hive</strong> and <strong>OpenSearch</strong>. Programming is done using <strong>Python</strong> while leveraging <strong>Apache Spark</strong> for heavy data transformations. The results in Apache Airflow are in the form of <strong>DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)</strong>, with hundreds of DAGs created. Before the production process, many simulations were conducted in the notebook, particularly using <strong>Apache Zeppelin</strong>, before finally being transformed into DAGs ready for use. Below is the flow of the created DAG.
</p>

![Alt Text](/pic/dag_1.png)
Figure 2.2

<p align="justify">
Data entering Apache Hive is not processed because the incoming data must match the source data as original data. Meanwhile, data processing occurs if the data enters as OpenSearch Index, including <strong>data cleansing</strong> and <strong>data transforming</strong>.
</p>

Data cleansing and data transforming are two essential stages in the data processing process, but they have different focuses and goals.

Data cleansing, or data cleaning, is the process aimed at identifying and correcting errors in the data. This process includes various activities, such as:
1. **Error Identification**: Checking the data to find anomalies, such as duplications, missing values, or format mismatches. For example, if a dataset contains empty values or typos, the initial step is to identify these issues.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminating identical entries in the dataset to ensure that each record is unique.
3. **Data Correction**: Fixing errors in the data, such as changing inconsistent date formats or correcting spelling mistakes. This is crucial to ensure that the data can be used for accurate analysis.
4. **Data Validation**: Ensuring that the collected data meets certain criteria, such as reasonable value ranges or correct formats. For example, this might involve checking whether all email addresses are in the correct format.

Data transforming, or data transformation, is the process aimed at changing the data into a format that is more suitable for analysis or further processing. This process includes various activities, such as:
1. **Normalization**: Changing the scale of data so that it can be compared consistently. For example, if we have budget data in different currencies, we may need to convert everything into one currency.
2. **Aggregation**: Combining data from multiple sources or different levels of granularity to provide a more holistic view. For instance, summing total budgets per activity or sub-activity.
3. **Feature Creation**: Generating new variables from existing data to enhance the analysis or prediction models, such as flagging extremely poor regions.
4. **Changing Data Structure**: Modifying the data format, such as converting from a table format to JSON format (or vice versa), or changing data types (e.g., from string to integer) to meet the needs of the the application.

**Advance Analytics: RFM and Machine Learning**

Perform regional government clustering using RFM and machine learning with K-Means model to identify regions that lack synergy with the government's mission in combating extreme poverty. 

RFM can be performed manually or automatically. Manual segmentation takes a lot of time and effort, which is why automating the business process is often preferred. One such approach is to use specialized tools for region segmentation. A CDP (Customer Data Platform) is used as a source to obtain data related to region behavior, making the segmentation process more accurate. RFM is suitable for region segmentation because it considers region behavior based on the following three aspects:

1. RECENCY (R): The time since the last program
2. FREQUENCY (F): The number of programs made
3. MONETARY VALUE (M): The total amount spent for all programs

Result:

![Alt Text](/pic/kementrian_ml_1.png)

Figure 2.5

We choose the model based on **recency** and **frequency** resulting in a total of 4 groups. The fourth rank of group should be considered because all regions in there are lack synergy with the government's mission.

## 2. Telkomsel Orbit - Data Analyst
### June 2023 - December 2023
<p align="justify">
Telkomsel is the first place I worked professionally, which is why I mostly helped my users in working on Telkomsel Orbit projects. As a data analyst, I primarily focused on compiling reporting dashboards on a weekly and monthly basis. Here, I utilized <strong>Microsoft Excel (especially the pivot feature)</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Power Point</strong>, <strong>Tableau</strong>, <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>. In addition to assisting my users, I took on the responsibility as the only person providing data needs from colleagues in the Telkomsel Orbit division using HiveQL (This company using Hadoop environment). The data needs from my colleagues varied, ranging from raw data to analytical results that informed decisions, especially in running campaigns related to the Telkomsel Orbit product.
